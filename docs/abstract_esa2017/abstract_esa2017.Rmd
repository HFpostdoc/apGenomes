### Abstract

- Climate change rates are currently on track with the worst case
  sencarios, resulting in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem responses
- Ants play important roles in ecosystems, including seed dispersal,
  which is a know factor in determining the rates of shifts in the
  range of many plant species
- Here, we present an analysis of a set of genomic sequences from six
  species in the genus Aphaenogaster, which is ecologically important
  in eastern forest ecosystems and has been shown to respond to
  changes in atmospheric temperature
- Analysis: Determine target analyses from recent ant and climate change
  genomics papers
- Results: 
- Conclusion:
