L32 Changed abstract to be more specific.

L61 Updating with directionality of crustacean cold temperature
response

L69 Added citations

Fig 1 Added ants (Formicidae)

L113 Removed sentence, was removed in a previous version, not sure how
it came back.

L114 Removed first sentence.

L153 Completed sentence.

L162 Streamlined wording of this paragraph.

L177 Clarified size similarity. 

L182 The sign of the R value indicates directionality. I added text to
indicate directionality for the aid of the reader. 

L192 Re-worded for clarity.

L207 Made the final sentence more specific to the findings.

L226 I added discussion of a couple of specific hypotheses about
direct and indirect selection of cold temperatures on genome size to
the last discussion paragraph. This builds more directly on the
literature already discussed, including John Stanton-Geddes
transcriptomics paper. 

L232 Lead to led.

L242 Added direction.

L249 Hessen is referring to nutrient limitation, however, this is a
useful reference as it ultimately makes the point that selection can
act both directly and indirectly to influence genome size.
